# `awsinfo assume [-d DurationInHours] [organisation-filters]+ -- [RoleName]`

`awsinfo assume` will assume the `ROLE_NAME` (or OrganizationAccountAccessRole by default)
for the filtered organisation account and print Environment Variables you can directly export
into your environment so you can work as the assumed role.

You need to be able to list Organisation accounts to use this command, if thats not possible
check out `assume role` for a command that lets you specify the account id and role options directly
and has MFA support.

## Organisations Filter matches against

* Name
* Id
* Status
* Email

## Example

Following is an example that prints the variables on the cli. You can then copy them by hand or eval them directly:
You can use `awsinfo me` to see which account you're using.

Lets say you have the following accounts:
```
awsinfo orgs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                                        ListAccounts                                         |
+------------------+---------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------+
|      1.Name      |     2.Id      | 3.Status  |                   4.Email                    |
+------------------+---------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------+
|  tslw-development|  123456789876 |  ACTIVE   |  development@theserverlessway.com            |
|  tslw-production |  987654321234 |  ACTIVE   |  production@theserverlessway.com             |
+------------------+---------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------+
```

We can then tell awsinfo we want to assume into the dev account. Filtering works the same for assume as it does
for other commands. If we don't add a role it will use the default role

```
awsinfo me
awsinfo assume dev

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=REDACTED_KEY AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=REDACTED_SECRET AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="REDACTED_TOKEN"
# COPY AND RUN EXPORTS NOW!

awsinfo me
```

If you want to set a specific Role you can do that as well of course

```
awsinfo assume dev -- SomeOtherRoleName
```

When you eval the output directly and run `awsinfo` in a Docker container you might run into problems with line
endings as Docker run with a TTY will add a carriage-return at the end of a line. the `tr -d '\r'` call will fix
this.

```
awsinfo me
eval $(awsinfo sts assume 12345678987654321 OrganizationAccountAccessRole --profile default | tr -d '\r')
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=REDACTED_KEY AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=REDACTED_SECRET AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="REDACTED_TOKEN"
awsinfo me
```
